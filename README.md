##About
Hello, my name is Angel Alberto Lechuga Milpas, I´m a graduate of UNAM Faculty of Engineering, i am in the process to be a Data Scientist and I´ve created this portfolio to show my steps and proyects trought this process.

During my collegue I developed interest in programming and stadistics because I saw that many engineering problems could be solve by simple analysis and we can used programming lenguages to build a tool in order to solve the problem. That´s why i started to take courses like desing of relational data bases, SQL, Excel and Python and Basic Web Developer in holidays to learn more about that toppings.

Actually I have the Introduction to Data Science course by CISCO and I´m in Data Analytics Essentials course that profundize more in the Data Analysis and teach me tools like Microsoft Excel, SQL and Tableau focuss on Data Analysis.
